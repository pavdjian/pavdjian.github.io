Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). ###vWhere does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

When the forecast is grim, whether it’s thunderstorms or a blizzard, cabin fever can set in fast. You can curl up with a great book or binge-watch an entire season of something, but, let’s face it, sometimes you want different, fun things to do at home. And if you have kids, you’re going to need a loooong menu of options. These ideas are good for families, groups of friends or roommates, or kids on their own (hallelujah!). There are relaxing activities—because when do you ever get the time to relax?—plus delicious ideas for eating and drinking. We’ve got games that require nothing more than your imagination. And for parents: entertaining projects for the kids that don’t involve video games (although one does involve mini marshmallows). So, forget about the soccer tournament that’s going to have to be rescheduled, ignore the yard work you were planning to do, put on your coziest pajamas, and pick one of these things to do at home. Embrace the day as time to recharge and reconnect with people you love. And don’t worry. The sun will (probably) come out tomorrow.
