However, since it was a sandbox style game, unless you had others who were keen to join in the fun there was little that you could do. About a year after its release, I bought a four pack, shared the extra copies amongst friends and proceeded to play it a grand total of 30 minutes. It has since sat in my Steam library untouched until this week when I was looking for an application to test a prototype card game. Due to various NDAs and verbal promises I can’t divulge much about the card game I wanted to prototype, however, I can show others how they could use Tabletop Simulator to import card designs in order to prototype and play test their own card games.

Long live the Connect IQ Eclipse Plugin! It has been about 5 months since Garmin held their annual developer conference, during which there was an entire breakout session for Connect IQ tools, including the all singing, all dancing, Visual Studio Code extension. Drinking the Kool-Aid, one would have thought Garmin had lowered the barrier to entry for development on the CIQ platform, in their own words Quote When Connect IQ launched, we provided a plugin for Eclipse as our development environment. The Eclipse IDE is sophisticated at best, and complicated at worst, to the point that Eclipse can be a barrier to entry for learning Connect IQ. The Eclipse environment isn’t great, the IDE feels outdated, it lacks extensibility and even the simplest tasks such as changing the default theme has you jumping through multiple hoops. Frankly, it was such a bad experience that I would only use Eclipse to edit my manifest.xml file. I actually went as far as adding a couple of functions to my ZSH profile so that I could avoid opening Eclipse for most everyday development. ZSH profile commands for the curious ### # Garmin Command Line Simulator ### ciq () { echo \"Starting ConnectIQ Simulator\" command ~/ConnectIQ/connectIQ echo \"Building Project: ${1}.prg \\nDevice Type: ${2}\" command ~/ConnectIQ/monkeyc -o bin/\"${1}\".prg -f monkey.jungle -y /key/garmin_developer_key -d \"${2}\" echo \"Starting ${1}.prg on ${2}\" command ~/ConnectIQ/monkeydo bin/\"${1}\".prg \"${2}\" } buildciq () { echo \"Starting Build of $1\" command ~/ConnectIQ/monkeyc --release --package-app --private-key /key/garmin_developer_key -f monkey.jungle -o IQ/$1.iq echo \"Build finished\" command ls -lah IQ/$1.iq } Despite these shortcomings, when it came to setting up Eclipse on your machine, Garmin provided you with a complete set of steps covering how to install and configure your development environment. In fact, at time of writing, taking at look at Garmin’s getting started and SDK documentation, Eclipse is still the chosen / supported development environment. Now, it is true that feature parity between the plugin for Visual Studio Code and Eclipse is not quite there, which would explain the reason for downplaying the VS Code side of CIQ development. However, were you to stumble across one of the few buried posts on Garmin Forums or the plugin’s marketplace page you’d be forgiven for thinking you only need to follow the following 5 steps to get up and running Quote Install extension Download the Connect IQ SDK Manager Download an SDK and set it as the current SDK using the SDK Manager Download devices using the SDK Manager Run the Monkey C: Verify Installation command to ensure the development environment is correctly setup That, I’m afraid, is not entirely accurate. There are a few gotchas I’ve come across while getting set up with the plugin and I thought it would be worthwhile mentioning them to save others the troubles I went through.

This may not matter to everyone, but I’d be surprised if I’m the only one who has fallen foul of this bug(?). I like to keep my things organised, so my code layout is something like this: garmin ├── faces │ ├── face1 │ └── face2 ├── fonts │ └── font1 └── widgets └── widget1 If I’m working on watch faces, I’ll usually open up a workspace in VS Code, which in turn loads my garmin/faces/* directories, the workspace is seen as a single parent folder in VS Code with all project folders available to me in that single tree view. Take the below screenshots, the first shows a workspace which is made up of a single folder, containing all other folders. This is how I usually use VS Code. The following screenshot, shows a workspace that is made up of multiple folders. The net result is largely the same, a view of my watch faces available from one sidebar, crucially however, only the setup in the second screenshot will allow you to run/build any of your applications. If you try to launch an application from the single folder workspace You end up with the following error Same project, same code, but different workspace layout You get a running application I’ve lost track of how many hours I spent trying to work this one out or where the issue lies.

You know, the bits of information that are only of any importance if you want to test or release your application. If you really wanted to, you could create and populate this file by hand, though I don’t think this is advised. \u003c!-- This is a generated file. It is highly recommended that you DO NOT edit this file. --\u003e That comment populates the head of all manifest files generated during project creation. I’m guessing it’s pretty important. Luckily for us, the Visual Studio Code plugin offers the ability to populate the manifest file automatically. That is, once you’ve completed the song and dance required to access the correct command from within the command palette. The plugin has several options which can be triggered, the options and their roles are below Monkey C: Edit Application - to update the application attributes Monkey C: Set Products by Version - lets you add all products that meet the minimum SDK version of the application Monkey C: Edit Products - lets you add or remove any product Monkey C: Edit Permissions - to update permissions Monkey C: Edit Languages - to edit your compatible language list Monkey C: Configure Monkey Barrel - to edit the included barrels Once triggered, you go on to complete a form like user interface that updates the manifest file as you work your way through it. So what’s the problem? Well, you see, while the above does work, and the UI/UX is most likely the best that can be done within the constraints of a Visual Studio Code plugin, it just isn’t as streamlined as Eclipse…yes, I said it. Eclipse actually offers a better experience for this task 🤯 The two areas which I think users will feel the impact of this new manifest editing system are: Ease of use - in Eclipse you don’t need to remember several different commands in order to edit different aspects of your manifest file, you simply click on the file itself and are taken to the manifest editor viewport. It’s not perfect, something could be said about the sheer amount whitespace and the small, almost invisible tabs at the bottom of the screen (which I’ve highlighted). At least everything is accessible in one place and I’m not going to forget which incantation of the command palette I need to edit a particular piece of the manifest file. Missing information - this is particularly pertinent when working with the ever increasing Garmin product list. In Eclipse, you could hover over a product and you’d get some basic information about its screen resolution and shape of a given product. This may seem to be irrelevant information, but when trying to support some 60+ products having the ability to check if a product is compatible with your application’s screen shape and resolution layouts is up there with knowing the memory constraints and SDK compatibility of each device. In the below screenshots you can see the Eclipse product list vs the Visual Studio Code product list alongside additional device data achieved by hovering over a product. Hint, only one screenshot shows this additional data, unsurprisingly, it’s also the one I prefer! Now in all honesty, if your desire is to really understand device compatibility there’s a web page that provides more information about the subject. But surely Garmin could fit a few extra characters somewhere in their Visual Studio Code dropdown? All in all, the Visual Studio Code plugin is still in development, Garmin have been releasing relatively frequently and I expect as Eclipse gets phased out in favour of VS Code, some of the UI and UX issues I’ve mentioned will get fixed.

You have a working internet connection and the Garmin Connect application is not having any problems. You’ve reset the bluetooth connection between your watch and phone and the watch is currently synced. The unlock code status field is showing my unlock code as invalid? Firstly, make sure you’re saving your settings after entering the unlock code by pressing “Done” or “Save”. Next, test some of the locked features. If they work, great your unlock code is working, if they don’t ensure that you have provided the correct unlock token and entered the unlock code correctly. Finally, exit out of the Connect/Connect IQ application and re-enter the settings page of the application.

In itself this sounded like an easy enough task so I went about designing the watch face thinking it would be a case of dropping the graphics in place and calling it a day. However, once I added the png I was asked to use I ended up with something similar to this Note Full disclosure, the image above is actually making use of a 16-bit sprite, but it gives a close approximation of the issue I was facing. In short, I had to find a consistent way to scale the source pixel art images to support the user’s device (as well as any other models I may need to support).

By default, the tool makes use of the Cubic interpolation filter, however by setting this filter to None I found that I was able to scale pixel art pretty much indefinitely. It also turned out this scaling method meant I didn’t have to try and clean up any interpolation artifacts. Pay particular attention to the image properties in the following two screenshots. I’ve had to zoom in to show that the filter has kept the sprite identical at both sizes, the original 16x21 pixels and the scaled 1600x2100 pixels. The “magic” behind this method of image scaling is that the filter copies the colour of each pixel from its closest neighbour. Often the result is an image that has aliasing or pixelation, though in my case (and pixel art in general) this isn’t a problem but I couldn’t recommend it for anything that may require anti-aliasing. Then again, other interpolation methods are available and are more suited to those use cases. Wrapping things up, a 1600x2100 resolution image might be a bit much for a watch that has a total screen resolution of 240x240, so if I was to scale my example image correctly I would end up with something like this And with that, thanks for reading.

I’ve settled on the use of GREEN, YELLOW and RED as they do a good job of communicating, errors, warnings, prompts and transitions between commands, however, you can always add or change the colours by updating the colour codes used.

So, open up the Horizon.prg.debug.xml, start searching for 268439730, find nothing, start removing digits from the end of the string until a match is found, something similar to this: \u003centry filename=\"/Users/pavdjian/gitspace/home/garmin/faces/Horizon/source/info.mc\" id=\"5\" lineNum=\"388\" pc=\"268439772\" symbol=\"draw\"/\u003e And it’s at this point that you’ve finally got any idea as to what might be going wrong. Unsurprisingly, having to do this this for multiple reports and apps is a relatively painful process.

The tool itself can be launched either from the command line era [-a \u003carg\u003e] [-k \u003carg\u003e] Where -a is your AppID and -k is the key file you used to create the app. Alternatively (and the way I use the tool), you could launch it from the Eclipse menu Connect IQ -\u003e Start ERA On first start up you’ll need to add your developer identity which is a case of entering your developer ID and developer key. Tip To obtain your developer ID search for your apps in the app store and click on your developer name. The URL for this page will contain your developer ID. For example, if the URL is https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/developer/5bfb3073-ce07-4509-bcae-771c5bef197e/apps then the developer ID is 5bfb3073-ce07-4509-bcae-771c5bef197e. Once you’ve done that, you should find you have access to all the apps you’ve released via a dropdown menu Clicking on one of them, will display any and all crash reports associated with the app Right away, it’s clear that the reports are presented in a much better format for developer. For a start they’re in plain(ish) English, you’re provided with the line of code where the error is happening. On top of that, being an anonymised crash reporter you get information from all users rather than only those who reach out to report a crash. Additionally, you get an occurrence count so that you’re able to focus on resolving the most common crashes first. You’re told the model of the watch which experienced the crash as well as the firmware version. Interestingly, the CIQ version is omitted now though. Finally, you’re given the real version of the app which is experiencing the crash rather than the Store-Version. All in all, this has made debugging applications so much easier and it has made it possible to make this a proactive process which results in a better experience for developers and users alike. And with that, it looks like I have a few crash reports to solve 😅. Thanks for reading.

Warning I’m not a frontend developer and haven’t really written javascript in a good few years, the below is just meant to showcase my approach to solving a problem rather than my prowess in making browsers do my bidding. Quick summary of the problem, I saw the “before” labels as a means of deciding what relabel configurations I wanted to introduce into each scrape configuration I was creating, however the “before” labels were only visible during a mouseover event which was frustrating me no end. Digging into the source code to understand how the mouseover tooltip is generated, I noticed that the list of “before” labels was not a dynamic page element, the content of the tooltip is embedded within the pages' HTML, so I knew I just needed a way to get to the underlying HTML. Initially this was achieved using the inspect element tool, this was ok if a bit clunky. While inspecting the list of labels I noticed a snippet of code data-toggle=\"tooltip\", surely we could change tooltip for something else. Chucking that snippet into Google, the search results all pointed to something called Bootstrap. I knew it was a javascript library, so I went over to the Bootstrap documentation to find out more. It just so happens that Bootstrap can provide a number of components to your page, I didn’t really know what I was after at the time so there was a bit of trial and error involved in finding the component with the behaviour that would suit my use case, but eventually I came across Popovers and they seemed to do what I wanted. The example code provided in the documentation also looked pretty similar to the tooltip code, so it felt like a pretty good replacement. Tooltips $(function () { $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').tooltip() }) Popovers $(function () { $('[data-toggle=\"popover\"]').popover() }) I assumed that since the tooltip functionality worked on labels, the jQuery selector for all '[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]' was working, but no harm in verifying Ok great, so can we change the tooltip() method for popover() method? $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').popover() That seemed to work nicely and I was quite content to stop there initially. However, as I started to make use of these popovers I quickly noticed that the default popover width wasn’t large enough and made reading label lists quite difficult as they spanned multiple lines a lot of the time. I noticed that when the popover is created, a new div is inserted into the DOM with a class of class=\"popover fade bs-popover-right show\", inspecting this element in the console I also noticed there was a max-width attribute defaulting to 276px. What if I were to change that value? $(\".popover\").css({\"max-width\":\"700px\"}) Perfect, well almost…See the problem is, if that DOM element doesn’t exist, the CSS change can’t take effect. In practice this meant every time I opened up a new popover, I’d have to re-run the CSS change. This could probably suffice for personal usage, it didn’t have to be perfect, but I’ve come this far and since I saw some use in what I was doing I thought to take it a step further and create something for folk across the organisation to use without having to copy and paste snippets every time they loaded the targets page. First thing’s first, I had to find all the labels on the page and add an EventListener to them. var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(\"badge badge-primary\"); for (var i = 0; i \u003c elements.length; i++) { elements[i].addEventListener('click', myFunction, false); } Next up was to package the commands I was running manually into a function which would be called each time the addEventListener is triggered. var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(\"badge badge-primary\"); var myFunction = function(){ $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').popover(); $(\".","date":"2020-06-28","objectID":"/posts/2020/06/28/prometheus-label-bookmarklet-rabbit-hole/:0:0","tags":["prometheus","metrics","monitoring"],"title":"Prometheus Label Bookmarklet Rabbit Hole","uri":"/posts/2020/06/28/prometheus-label-bookmarklet-rabbit-hole/"},{"categories":["Prometheus"],"content":"One of the most recent projects I’ve been involved with at work has been the exploration of Prometheus as a metrics and monitoring tool. I expect as I spend more time with the tooling I’ll probably be writing more posts, mostly in the “TIL” vain. Today, however, is not one of those posts. Instead, I wanted to show off a few lines of code I put together which I’ve found pretty useful when setting up our scrape configs. Fair warning, I’m not a front end developer, so brace yourselves while I introduce you to the hammer I used to solve this problem. Prometheus' target page allows you to see all labels associated with the metrics you scrape before and after relabelling, seeing the “before” labels is actually quite useful as it can help: Make sense of where exactly the metrics are coming from Dictate the configuration of scrape configurations Direct how relabel configurations are set up Ensure consistency between scrape configurations and queries However there is one glaring omission with the targets page, the “before” labels are only visible on mouseover. This makes it: Impossible to copy and paste “before” labels if you wish to discuss them Very difficult to view the entire list of “before” labels when it spans below the fold So that comparison between “before” and “after” labels is a test of patience I wrote a small bookmarklet, which you can activate when on your Prometheus targets page which will allow you to now click on a label to show the “before” labels as a popover rather than a tooltip. The end result looks something like this Compared to the default tooltip action, the popover remains even after your mouse moves away from the labels, which means you can now copy and paste, view labels side by side, dock your screen etc… without losing the “before” labels. Simply create a new bookmark in your browser and replace the URL field with javascript:for(var elements=document.getElementsByClassName(\"badge badge-primary\"),myFunction=function(){$('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').popover(),setTimeout(function(){$(\".popover\").css({\"max-width\":\"900px\"})},100)},i=0;i\u003celements.length;i++)elements[i].addEventListener(\"click\",myFunction,!1); It should look something like this Whenever you wish to make use of popovers rather than tooltips, click the bookmarketlet and then a label of your choosing, all labels on the targets page are clickable entities which can create a persistant popover.

Quick side note, for those that don’t know, a git gutter, diff decorator or VCS gutter is a small element that typically shows up on the side of your code files to indicate a change between your local copy of the file and that which the version control system is tracking. They look a little like this Back to the problem, I double, triple and quadruple checked my settings and extensions and couldn’t find anything amiss. I was perplexed, so I opened a new file within the same project and made some changes but nothing…Ok, what about a new project, open it up make a change and a wild git gutter appeared! Ok, so the same editor two different projects and I get two different results. So what was different about them? They both look like git repos in my terminal, behave like git repos when it comes to making changes, was it a language issue, the size of the repo, too many branches? There were too many variables, so I decided to start a fresh and see if I can pinpoint the issue. for i in foo bar; do mkdir ~/goatspace/$i; git init ~/goatspace/$i; done Right, we have our test repos, time to add them to VS Code as projects, I use the excellent extension Project Manager, so I opened up the extension settings and added links to my two newly initialised git repos. [ { \"name\": \"Foo\", \"rootPath\": \"/Users/pavdjian/goatspace/foo\", \"paths\": [], \"group\": \"\", \"enabled\": true }, { \"name\": \"Bar\", \"rootPath\": \"/Users/pavdjian/gitspace/bar\", \"paths\": [], \"group\": \"\", \"enabled\": true } ] For the astute amongst you, you’ll notice two different rootPaths. » ls -lah bar lrwxr-xr-x 1 pavdjian pavdjian 29B 2 Jun 22:34 bar -\u003e /Users/pavdjian/goatspace/bar This setup difference was by design to mimic the setup of the projects I was comparing against earlier. Time to see if any git gutter decorations show up in these new test repos. for i in foo bar; do echo \"this is a test\" \u003e\u003e ~/goatspace/$i/test.txt; done Looking at our editor, we can see the window tracking the Bar project is not showing any file highlighting. Untracked Files (image)\" Untracked Files (image) I should state at this point neither file is showing a git gutter, but that’s expected at this point since the files are untracked as far as git is concerned. Let’s make a quick commit for i in foo bar; do cd ~/goatspace/$i; git add .; git commit -m \"New file\"; done Then we’ll edit the files again for i in foo bar; do echo \"this is a second test\" \u003e\u003e ~/goatspace/$i/test.txt; done And now we see a git gutter appear in the Foo project window, but not in the Bar project. So it seems, VS Code doesn’t show the git gutter when the file that it is opening is coming from a symlink. If I was to open the file from the hard linked goatspace directory though code ~/goatspace/bar All the wonderful git decorations are present and working. For what it’s worth, I’ve not seen this behaviour before, vim for instance seems happy to show the decorations whether the file is opened via symlink or not. And with that, thanks for reading.
