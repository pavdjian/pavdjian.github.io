# Rainy Days


# Rain Rain Go Away

It’s raining, it’s pouring, your day feels really boring—and you're racking your brain for what to do on a rainy day.

When the forecast is grim, whether it’s thunderstorms or a blizzard, cabin fever can set in fast. You can curl up with a great book or binge-watch an entire season of something, but, let’s face it, sometimes you want different, fun things to do at home. And if you have kids, you’re going to need a loooong menu of options.

These ideas are good for families, groups of friends or roommates, or kids on their own (hallelujah!). There are relaxing activities—because when do you ever get the time to relax?—plus delicious ideas for eating and drinking. We’ve got games that require nothing more than your imagination. And for parents: entertaining projects for the kids that don’t involve video games (although one does involve mini marshmallows).

So, forget about the soccer tournament that’s going to have to be rescheduled, ignore the yard work you were planning to do, put on your coziest pajamas, and pick one of these things to do at home. Embrace the day as time to recharge and reconnect with people you love. And don’t worry. The sun will (probably) come out tomorrow.
