Warning I‚Äôm not a frontend developer and haven‚Äôt really written javascript in a good few years, the below is just meant to showcase my approach to solving a problem rather than my prowess in making browsers do my bidding. Quick summary of the problem, I saw the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels as a means of deciding what relabel configurations I wanted to introduce into each scrape configuration I was creating, however the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels were only visible during a mouseover event which was frustrating me no end. Digging into the source code to understand how the mouseover tooltip is generated, I noticed that the list of ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels was not a dynamic page element, the content of the tooltip is embedded within the pages‚Äô HTML, so I knew I just needed a way to get to the underlying HTML. Initially this was achieved using the inspect element tool, this was ok if a bit clunky. While inspecting the list of labels I noticed a snippet of code data-toggle=\"tooltip\", surely we could change tooltip for something else. Chucking that snippet into Google, the search results all pointed to something called Bootstrap. I knew it was a javascript library, so I went over to the Bootstrap documentation to find out more. It just so happens that Bootstrap can provide a number of components to your page, I didn‚Äôt really know what I was after at the time so there was a bit of trial and error involved in finding the component with the behaviour that would suit my use case, but eventually I came across Popovers and they seemed to do what I wanted. The example code provided in the documentation also looked pretty similar to the tooltip code, so it felt like a pretty good replacement. Tooltips $(function () { $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').tooltip() }) Popovers $(function () { $('[data-toggle=\"popover\"]').popover() }) I assumed that since the tooltip functionality worked on labels, the jQuery selector for all '[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]' was working, but no harm in verifying Ok great, so can we change the tooltip() method for popover() method? $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').popover() That seemed to work nicely and I was quite content to stop there initially. However, as I started to make use of these popovers I quickly noticed that the default popover width wasn‚Äôt large enough and made reading label lists quite difficult as they spanned multiple lines a lot of the time. I noticed that when the popover is created, a new div is inserted into the DOM with a class of class=\"popover fade bs-popover-right show\", inspecting this element in the console I also noticed there was a max-width attribute defaulting to 276px. What if I were to change that value? $(\".popover\").css({\"max-width\":\"700px\"}) Perfect, well almost‚Ä¶See the problem is, if that DOM element doesn‚Äôt exist, the CSS change can‚Äôt take effect. In practice this meant every time I opened up a new popover, I‚Äôd have to re-run the CSS change. This could probably suffice for personal usage, it didn‚Äôt have to be perfect, but I‚Äôve come this far and since I saw some use in what I was doing I thought to take it a step further and create something for folk across the organisation to use without having to copy and paste snippets every time they loaded the targets page. First thing‚Äôs first, I had to find all the labels on the page and add an EventListener to them. var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(\"badge badge-primary\"); for (var i = 0; i \u003c elements.length; i++) { elements[i].addEventListener('click', myFunction, false); } Next up was to package the commands I was running manually into a function which would be called each time the addEventListener is triggered. var elements = document.getElementsByClassName(\"badge badge-primary\"); var myFunction = function(){ $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').popover(); $(\".","date":"2020-06-28","objectID":"/posts/2020/06/28/prometheus-label-bookmarklet-rabbit-hole/:0:0","tags":["prometheus","metrics","monitoring"],"title":"Prometheus Label Bookmarklet Rabbit Hole","uri":"/posts/2020/06/28/prometheus-label-bookmarklet-rabbit-hole/"},{"categories":["Prometheus"],"content":"One of the most recent projects I‚Äôve been involved with at work has been the exploration of Prometheus as a metrics and monitoring tool. I expect as I spend more time with the tooling I‚Äôll probably be writing more posts, mostly in the ‚ÄúTIL‚Äù vain. Today, however, is not one of those posts. Instead, I wanted to show off a few lines of code I put together which I‚Äôve found pretty useful when setting up our scrape configs. Fair warning, I‚Äôm not a front end developer, so brace yourselves while I introduce you to the hammer I used to solve this problem. Prometheus‚Äô target page allows you to see all labels associated with the metrics you scrape before and after relabelling, seeing the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels is actually quite useful as it can help: Make sense of where exactly the metrics are coming from Dictate the configuration of scrape configurations Direct how relabel configurations are set up Ensure consistency between scrape configurations and queries However there is one glaring omission with the targets page, the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels are only visible on mouseover. This makes it: Impossible to copy and paste ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels if you wish to discuss them Very difficult to view the entire list of ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels when it spans below the fold So that comparison between ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù labels is a test of patience I wrote a small bookmarklet, which you can activate when on your Prometheus targets page which will allow you to now click on a label to show the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels as a popover rather than a tooltip. The end result looks something like this Compared to the default tooltip action, the popover remains even after your mouse moves away from the labels, which means you can now copy and paste, view labels side by side, dock your screen etc‚Ä¶ without losing the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù labels. Simply create a new bookmark in your browser and replace the URL field with javascript:for(var elements=document.getElementsByClassName(\"badge badge-primary\"),myFunction=function(){$('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').popover(),setTimeout(function(){$(\".popover\").css({\"max-width\":\"900px\"})},100)},i=0;i\u003celements.length;i++)elements[i].addEventListener(\"click\",myFunction,!1); It should look something like this Whenever you wish to make use of popovers rather than tooltips, click the bookmarketlet and then a label of your choosing, all labels on the targets page are clickable entities which can create a persistant popover.

Quick side note, for those that don‚Äôt know, a git gutter, diff decorator or VCS gutter is a small element that typically shows up on the side of your code files to indicate a change between your local copy of the file and that which the version control system is tracking. They look a little like this Back to the problem, I double, triple and quadruple checked my settings and extensions and couldn‚Äôt find anything amiss. I was perplexed, so I opened a new file within the same project and made some changes but nothing‚Ä¶Ok, what about a new project, open it up make a change and a wild git gutter appeared! Ok, so the same editor two different projects and I get two different results. So what was different about them? They both look like git repos in my terminal, behave like git repos when it comes to making changes, was it a language issue, the size of the repo, too many branches? There were too many variables, so I decided to start a fresh and see if I can pinpoint the issue. for i in foo bar; do mkdir ~/goatspace/$i; git init ~/goatspace/$i; done Right, we have our test repos, time to add them to VS Code as projects, I use the excellent extension Project Manager, so I opened up the extension settings and added links to my two newly initialised git repos. [ { \"name\": \"Foo\", \"rootPath\": \"/Users/pavdjian/goatspace/foo\", \"paths\": [], \"group\": \"\", \"enabled\": true }, { \"name\": \"Bar\", \"rootPath\": \"/Users/pavdjian/gitspace/bar\", \"paths\": [], \"group\": \"\", \"enabled\": true } ] For the astute amongst you, you‚Äôll notice two different rootPaths. ¬ª ls -lah bar lrwxr-xr-x 1 pavdjian pavdjian 29B 2 Jun 22:34 bar -\u003e /Users/pavdjian/goatspace/bar This setup difference was by design to mimic the setup of the projects I was comparing against earlier. Time to see if any git gutter decorations show up in these new test repos. for i in foo bar; do echo \"this is a test\" \u003e\u003e ~/goatspace/$i/test.txt; done Looking at our editor, we can see the window tracking the Bar project is not showing any file highlighting. Untracked Files (image)\" Untracked Files (image) I should state at this point neither file is showing a git gutter, but that‚Äôs expected at this point since the files are untracked as far as git is concerned. Let‚Äôs make a quick commit for i in foo bar; do cd ~/goatspace/$i; git add .; git commit -m \"New file\"; done Then we‚Äôll edit the files again for i in foo bar; do echo \"this is a second test\" \u003e\u003e ~/goatspace/$i/test.txt; done And now we see a git gutter appear in the Foo project window, but not in the Bar project. So it seems, VS Code doesn‚Äôt show the git gutter when the file that it is opening is coming from a symlink. If I was to open the file from the hard linked goatspace directory though code ~/goatspace/bar All the wonderful git decorations are present and working. For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve not seen this behaviour before, vim for instance seems happy to show the decorations whether the file is opened via symlink or not. And with that, thanks for reading.
