Quick side note, for those that don‚Äôt know, a git gutter, diff decorator or VCS gutter is a small element that typically shows up on the side of your code files to indicate a change between your local copy of the file and that which the version control system is tracking. They look a little like this Back to the problem, I double, triple and quadruple checked my settings and extensions and couldn‚Äôt find anything amiss. I was perplexed, so I opened a new file within the same project and made some changes but nothing‚Ä¶Ok, what about a new project, open it up make a change and a wild git gutter appeared! Ok, so the same editor two different projects and I get two different results. So what was different about them? They both look like git repos in my terminal, behave like git repos when it comes to making changes, was it a language issue, the size of the repo, too many branches? There were too many variables, so I decided to start a fresh and see if I can pinpoint the issue. for i in foo bar; do mkdir ~/goatspace/$i; git init ~/goatspace/$i; done Right, we have our test repos, time to add them to VS Code as projects, I use the excellent extension Project Manager, so I opened up the extension settings and added links to my two newly initialised git repos. [ { \"name\": \"Foo\", \"rootPath\": \"/Users/pavdjian/goatspace/foo\", \"paths\": [], \"group\": \"\", \"enabled\": true }, { \"name\": \"Bar\", \"rootPath\": \"/Users/pavdjian/gitspace/bar\", \"paths\": [], \"group\": \"\", \"enabled\": true } ] For the astute amongst you, you‚Äôll notice two different rootPaths. ¬ª ls -lah bar lrwxr-xr-x 1 pavdjian pavdjian 29B 2 Jun 22:34 bar -\u003e /Users/pavdjian/goatspace/bar This setup difference was by design to mimic the setup of the projects I was comparing against earlier. Time to see if any git gutter decorations show up in these new test repos. for i in foo bar; do echo \"this is a test\" \u003e\u003e ~/goatspace/$i/test.txt; done Looking at our editor, we can see the window tracking the Bar project is not showing any file highlighting. Untracked Files (image)\" Untracked Files (image) I should state at this point neither file is showing a git gutter, but that‚Äôs expected at this point since the files are untracked as far as git is concerned. Let‚Äôs make a quick commit for i in foo bar; do cd ~/goatspace/$i; git add .; git commit -m \"New file\"; done Then we‚Äôll edit the files again for i in foo bar; do echo \"this is a second test\" \u003e\u003e ~/goatspace/$i/test.txt; done And now we see a git gutter appear in the Foo project window, but not in the Bar project. So it seems, VS Code doesn‚Äôt show the git gutter when the file that it is opening is coming from a symlink. If I was to open the file from the hard linked goatspace directory though code ~/goatspace/bar All the wonderful git decorations are present and working. For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve not seen this behaviour before, vim for instance seems happy to show the decorations whether the file is opened via symlink or not. And with that, thanks for reading.

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‚Äòlorem ipsum‚Äô will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don‚Äôt look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn‚Äôt anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
