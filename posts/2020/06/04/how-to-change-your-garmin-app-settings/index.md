# How to Change Your Garmin App Settings


In my time developing apps for Garmin wearables there is no doubt that the most common question I'm asked by users is how to update the settings of an application.

There are three ways to update your apps, I'll detail all of them below.

### 1. Garmin Connect App on Your Phone
* Open your Garmin Connect App on your [Android](https://links.avdjian.com/androidconnect) or [Apple](https://links.avdjian.com/appleconnect) device

* Make sure your watch is connected to your phone

* Tap the watch icon at the top of the screen

* Select the `Appearance` menu item

{{< admonition type=info title="Info - click to expand" open=false >}}
It would be remiss of me not to mention this, if you want to edit the likes of data fields through the Garmin Connect App, you'll need to click on the `Activities, Apps and More` menu item instead of `Appearance`.

{{< /admonition >}}

* Select either `Watchfaces` or `Widgets`

### 3. Garmin Express
* First thing's first, make sure you have [downloaded and installed Garmin Express](https://links.avdjian.com/garminexpress)
* Next, connect your watch with the appropriate USB cable and wait for it to show as being connected

  {{< image src="/posts/images/2020/06/04/express1.png" >}}
* Click your device and select the `IQ Apps` menu

  {{< image src="/posts/images/2020/06/04/express2.png" >}}
* You'll now see a list of all apps installed on your device, find the one you want and click the ellipsis

  {{< image src="/posts/images/2020/06/04/express3.png" >}}
* Set them as you want and make sure to save üëç

That's it, three different ways to edit your watch settings, be it watch faces, data fields or widgets.

And with that, thanks for reading.
